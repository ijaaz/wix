10th Grade

*10th Grade Benchmark: I can use evidence to establish, support, and defend my opinion.*

Critical thinking is essential in my use of the internet, because on the internet, it is harder to distinguish falsehood from truth because there is so many opinionated people in the world and many of them use the internet. Because all these opinionated people air these opinions on the web, it is very important for me to be able to validate opinions and separate falsehood from fact.

In my English class, we had an English guided project (you get to choose subjects, teachers create a deadline to help), in which we created persuasive essays about different current events that concerned us. 

My subject was gay marriage. I chose this topic because at the time of this writing it is a controversial subject, with a lot of ramifications to our society and government(USA).

My paper was arguing - controversially - that the opponents of gay marriage had reasons other than intolerance gay people, and that they were important reasons to highlight. 

The largest challenge facing me in this project was gaining information, specifically, reliable, and unbiased information. 

Most articles on this subject were too opinionated to use as sources, fortunately I had great tools at my disposal, including readability (a tool to read articles offline and without fluff). This tool was really useful, as I do not have internet at home. I also found that I could use it to tag and organize a lot of data at once. 

The worst part of writing for me was editing my paper, I especially found it hard because I was not used to writing in that style. Yet, because of this challenge, I have grown to be a better writer.

Hopefully as time goes on I will be challenged with more writing assignments so that my writing will become phenomenal.
