*11th Grade Benchmark: I understand and appreciate the importance of taking a leadership role for a group*

Leaders are a needed ingredient for life, if there was no leader, nothing would ever be done.

Leaders help inspire community, they help set a tone, they are the glue holding communities together, without them, there would be no community.

A community starts with people and a leader, all with common purpose, or
interest. 

Leaders only come around when they are needed, because need is the most
powerful of necessities, and because leadership is not totally inborn, but
instead, is something you gain.

Anyone can be a leader, as the qualities of leader is not inborn, but instead
is learned.

Charisma, a needed leadership quality, is something that can be inborn, but
also can be gained, actually, many leaders are somewhat charismatic, but gain
an extra dose of charisma when they become leaders.
