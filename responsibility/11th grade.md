Responsibility

*11th Grade Benchmark: I understand and appreciate the importance of taking a leadership role for a group*

Leadership is the focal point of human effort. Communities without leaders are apt to disintegrate into chaos.

Everyone has a different view on the world. This leads to conflicting views, and eventually conflict. Good leaders create compromise, peace (as so far as possible), and focus.

Good leaders are not always made for leadership, but instead are called on to be leaders. 

## My Experience

I recently had the honer of creating a fictional business plan with my friend Nicky.

This business plan was for my Economics class with Mrs. Polaczyk. Our fictional business' product was a 3-D Printer for the masses.

We created a presention and a paper.  This [paper](1) detailed our business goals and strategies. We created our presentation to present these ideas to a select group of teachers and students.

We started out doing well, till Nicky started to feel unwell. Due to this, I found out that I had to take a larger leadership role.
