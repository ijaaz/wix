Responsibility
===============

What Is Responsibility?
-----------------------

Responsibility is a commitment to completing a goal, doing what needs to be
done(even if your partner is not willing).

Responsibility creates greater output for groups, a sense of community, and
improves society overall.

Responsibility is an important skill to learn, because you will need it later on
in life, no matter what path you take. In a high school like FlexTech, there
is an increased need for responsibility because "with great power(or great
freedom) comes great responsibility".

10th Grade Benchmark: I understand and appreciate my responsibility to a group

To me being responsible to a group means getting thing done even if you don't
want to.  If people in a group are not responsible, than the individuals that
are will feel cheated.  In a group people take turns at being leaders,
followers, and artisans so that people will develop different skills.  These
rotations of positions and importance helps develop real-world responsibility,
because you will not always be the boss or the follower. 

{insert evidence here}

I recently had a assigned group project in my health class where we created
a game {insert name}. We met as a group around once a week, we did
tolerably well in communicating our goals. 

Our group finished before the deadline but the other groups in our class were
irresponsible in the extreme, and didn't finish their projects on time.  As
a result, our group suffered because we couldn't do our presentation portion of
the assignment, even though we got our game part done on time. 

So, by the time all the other groups caught up, I had forgotten a lot of what
we had done. 

In this project I was trying to be a good teammate; we as a group were trying
to finish before everyone else, and make the best game possible. In this game
we used unique fonts, a tree-like instruction, and a papyrus-like
paper for our questions.

The largest challenge my team faced on this project was that we where really
ahead of everyone else; because of that I forgot how the game was actually
played (I made the game really obtuse).

If I could go back and change something, I'd tell us to slow down, and I'd make
my game less obtuse.

In this project, I designed the game; I was unsure if I could do a good job,
but with the help of Mrs. Smith(a math teacher in Flextech high school), and
determination, I did a pretty good job. This experience has taught me that with
determination you can do a passable job, even if you are not really good at it.

11th Grade Benchmark: I understand and appreciate the importance of taking
a leadership role for a group

Leaders are a needed ingredient for life, if there was no leader, nothing would
ever be done.

Leaders help inspire community, they help set a tone, they are the glue holding
communities together, without them, there would be no community.

A community starts with people and a leader, all with common purpose, or
interest. 

Leaders only come around when they are needed, because need is the most
powerful of necessities, and because leadership is not totally inborn, but
instead, is something you gain.

Anyone can be a leader, as the qualities of leader is not inborn, but instead
is learned.

Charisma, a needed leadership quality, is something that can be inborn, but
also can be gained, actually, many leaders are somewhat charismatic, but gain
an extra dose of charisma when they become leaders.
