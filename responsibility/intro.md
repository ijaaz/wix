What Is Responsibility?
-----------------------

Responsibility is a commitment to completing a goal, doing what needs to be done(even if your partner is not willing).

Responsibility creates greater output for groups, a sense of community, and improves society overall.

Responsibility is an important skill to learn, because you will need it later on in life, no matter what path you take. In a high school like FlexTech, there is an increased need for responsibility because "with great power(or great freedom) comes great responsibility".
