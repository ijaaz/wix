What Is Responsibility?

10th Grade Benchmark: I Understand And Appreciate My Responsibility To A Group.

To me, responsibility is commitment to completing a goal, willingness to self sacrifice, and doing what needs to be done, even if your partner is not willing. Responsibility creates greater output for groups, a sense of community, and improves society overall.

Responsibility is an important skill to learn because you will need it later on in life, no matter what path you take. In a high school, like FlexTech, there is an increased need for responsibility because "with great power(or great freedom) comes great responsibility".
