What Is Responsibility?

10th Grade Benchmark: I Understand And Appreciate My Responsibility To A Group.

To me, responsibility is commitment to completing a goal, willingness to self sacrifice, and doing what needs to be done, even if your partner is not willing. Responsibility creates greater output for groups, a sense of community, and improves society overall.

Responsibility is an important skill to learn because you will need it later on in life, no matter what path you take. In a high school, like FlexTech, there is an increased need for responsibility because "with great power(or great freedom) comes great responsibility". 

# 10th Grade Benchmark: I understand and appreciate my responsibility to a group


To me being responsible to a group means getting thing done even if you don't want to.  If people in a group are not responsible, than the individuals that are will feel cheated.  In a group people take turns at being leaders, followers, and artisans so that people will develop different skills.  These rotations of positions and importance helps develop real-world responsibility, because you will not always be the boss or the follower.

I recently had a assigned group project in my health class where we created a game {insert name}. we met as a group around once a week where we did tolerably well at communicating our goals. Our group finished before the deadline but the other groups in our class were irresponsible in the extreme, and didn't finish their projects on time.  As a result, our group suffered because we couldn't do the presentation portion of the assignment, even though we got our part done on time.  So, by the time all the other groups caught up, I had forgotten a lot of what we did.

ï»¿In this project I was trying to be a good teammate and we as a group were trying to finish before everyone else and make the best game in comparison to the other teams. In the game we used unique fonts and a tree-like instruction, we also made papyrus-like paper for our questions. The largest challenge I faced on this project was that we where really ahead of everyone else, because of that I forgot how the game was actually played (cause I made the game really obtuse), If I could go back and change something I'd tell us to slow down and I'd make my game less obtuse. In this project I designed the game and was unsure if I could do a good job, but with the help of Mrs.Smith(a math teacher in Flextech high school) and determination I did a pretty good job. This expedience has taught me that with determination you can do a passable job even if you are note really good at it.
