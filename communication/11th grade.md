*11th Grade Benchmark: I can communicate effectively in writing*

Good writing is tantamount to having a successful life, because without good writing, you would not be able to communicate with others to the degree you'd wish for.

Effective writing is clear, concise, informative, and coherent.

## My Experience

I recently created this website for my wix project, during which I had to contend with lost work and motivation.

I had everything on my wix written, when my hard-drive conked. I had written everything in a 1 day period, and had no internet at the time, so I was not able to back it up onto the cloud.

I am fairly certain that everything you, my fair visitor, are reading is a lot worse than my original version. 

I also had motivation problems, as it is hard to motivate ones-self to work on something twice.

My motivation has impacted my mind ability to form coherent thought, as such, impacted my writing.

If I could redo this, I'd have made online backups of my work.
