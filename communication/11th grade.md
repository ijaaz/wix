*11th Grade Benchmark: I can communicate effectively in writing*

Good writing is tantamount to having a successful life, because without good writing, you would not be able to communicate with others to the degree you'd wish for.

Effective writing is clear, concise, informative, and coherent.

## My Experience

I recently created this website for my wix project, during which I had to contend with lost work, motivation, and communication issues.

I  struggled, struggled, to communicate what I had experienced in my scholastic adventures.

This was because, when I had originally written of my experiences, my mind had emptied it's self of these past experiences.

And then I lost everything when my hard-drive conked.  I wrote everything in a 1 day period, and had no internet at the time, so I was not able to back it up onto the cloud.

And honestly, the first time I wrote my wix, I had a crutch of monumental proportions, specifically a new computer.

It has been scientifically shown that a new experience boosts your productivity levels for a limited time.

Actually, I wrote this sentence on a piece of paper, something I so rarely do, as to be an essentially newish experience.

The reason that doing new things, or having new things, is a **monumental** crutch, instead of a small crutch, is because of 2 specifically paradoxical mental disabilities. 

Autism and ADHD are my two main mental disabilities, the silly thing is, is that they are the opposite of each other, creating a mental tug-of-war.

ADHD (in it's simplest forms) is essentially having a low attention span, while Autism is the opposite, being a high attention span. This combination is like fire and oil, not fun.

Something new is monumental to me because I get a clarity of focus from my Autism, and I need that focus, because without it, I would not be able to do anything.

If I could redo this, I'd have made online backups of my work, and tried writing sooner on paper the second time.
