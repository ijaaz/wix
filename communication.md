this fast paced world.

10th grade benchmark: I can communicate effectively orally.

Communication is essential, in relationships of all kinds, otherwise there will
be times where there *will* be misunderstandings and confusion which leads to
dire consequences. Communication is important in understanding peoples actions.
Communication is important to having good relationships.

I recently did a group project in biology, we created habitable planets,
choosing the most earth-like planet, then adding an ecosystem that would be
suited for that specific planet. We then presented our planet to our teacher and
explained our climate choices. 

In my biology project I was trying to master a challenging topic. We had many
obstacles in our way, my partner and teacher had to leave early at times, and
sometimes my partner was not able to be at class some days. 

If I could have done things differently, I'd have created multiple copy's of
our project so that I would be able to work on my project, even if my partner
was not in. 

In the future when I have a group project I will hopefully make multiple copy
so that I am less dependent on my partner.
